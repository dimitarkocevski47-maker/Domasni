    <h1 id="intro">My Hobby: Photography</h1>

    <p>
        I enjoy photography because it allows me to capture moments and tell stories through images. 
        Sometimes I like experimenting with <strong>bold lighting</strong> or 
        writing small <em>notes</em> about each photo.  
        I learned more about certain camera techniques from an article on 
        <a href="https://www.photographylife.com" target="_blank">Photography Life</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        I especially enjoy taking pictures during nature walks. 
        When I find a beautiful scene, I often pause, breathe, and take a photo.<br>
        Sometimes I even <u>underline</u> or <mark>highlight</mark> my favorite tips in my notebook.

        Photography helps me slow down and appreciate the world. It's both creative and relaxing.
